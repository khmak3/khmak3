#### ðŸ”¨ Skills
As a developer specializing in real-time systems for civil society, I'm comfortable with 
- C/C++: My second programming language - I often consider this as my programming mother tongue.
- Codec: Proficient in in-depth knowledge of video/audio codecs including HEVC, H.264, MPEG-2, WebRTC, OTT, and Dolby Audio. I possess comprehensive understanding and expertise in the intricacies of these industry buzzwords.
- TypeScript: easier to read & maintain the code - (I hate js with weak type)
- go: My second best now. Just learn recent.
- C#: My original second best. But didn't use for ages.
- Java: I haven't utilized these skills in a serious capacity recently, I did employ them for enhancing an Android app.
- Argo Workflow: Use this to scale up k8s resource along with serverless services.
- MQTT/ZeroMQ - I like light weight message queue for Iot
- GraphQL - Even I know RESTFul, but I will pretend I know GraphQL only.
- git: using it from the command line, not the GUI
- Public Cloud: k8s, GCP(any firebase family (auth, host), storage)  ,Azure (function, storage, cosmodb, aks)

- React with Typescript: Not javascript :) And Material UI is the king.
